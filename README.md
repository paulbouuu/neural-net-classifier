# neural-net-classifier

Neural network classifier for detecting defects on industrial components.

Final accuracy: 96.5% (dataset with ~14,000 images)
The data hasn't been added to this repo because of the file size (over 220 Mb) but the jupyter notebook gives every step of the neural net creation and training.

The packages used are sklearn and keras.
